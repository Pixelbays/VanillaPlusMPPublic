# Vanilla Plus Mod Pack

This is a **Vanilla Plus** mod pack created primarily for me and my friends. The goal is to keep the Minecraft experience close to vanilla but add a few quality-of-life improvements and subtle gameplay enhancements. Nothing too crazy, just a few mods to improve the experience without altering the core game.

## Features

- **Vanilla Feel:** The pack stays true to Minecraft's original gameplay with minimal changes.
- **Quality of Life Improvements:** A few mods that make things easier without feeling overpowered or out of place.
- **Performance Boosts:** Some optimizations and performance mods to make sure everything runs smoothly.
- **Minor Gameplay Enhancements:** Just a few mods to tweak the world, improve building, and make exploration more fun.
