<h1>Heru’s Vanilla+</h1>

Want to play modded Minecraft? Don’t wanna play a new game with how some Mod packs are? Want to play ***Vanilla but Plus?***

WARNING: This pack is for friends group and SMP. The WHOLE pack CAN AND WILL change at any time. If you like your version you are always welcome to use the older versions of the pack.

Currently, I am testing this Pack out for that Vanilla Feel but with a bit more spice!

Make your home feel like a real home with new items and blocks that keep the vanilla feel!

    <summary>Warnings and Suggestions!</summary>
    <ul>
    <li>This pack is currently for my friend group, not full release. Do not expect a fully flushed out pack until we are happy with the balance, expect things to be able to change drasticly between versions. Once again this pack is mainly for my group of friends and we will change things as we see fit.</li>
    <li>I am still <b>testing and balancing</b> mods that should or shouldn’t be in this pack So things WILL change until I find that balance. If you have feedback, suggestions, a bone to pick, etc send a message in the discord</li>
    <li>
    <b>Sound Settings!</b>
    <ul>
    <li>The Default Minecraft Settings</li>
    <li>Check Mod Settings in Mod Menu, Presence Footsteps for example I find is way too loud by default</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>I Suggest running with 2-6GB of RAM for Java</li>
    </ul>
